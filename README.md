# Python Tutorial for Banking Analysts: Sessions 1 & 2

This repository contains a two-part Python tutorial designed specifically for business analysts in the banking sector, focusing on Python programming fundamentals, object-oriented programming (OOP), and data visualization using `matplotlib`.

## Tutorial Overview

The tutorial is divided into two sessions, each 1.5 hours long:

- **Session 1: Python Refresher, OOP Concepts, and Basic Banking System Building**
- **Session 2: Data Visualization Techniques**

The entire tutorial is beginner-friendly and assumes some prior scripting experience. All code examples can be combined into a simple banking system that covers key Python and OOP concepts. No external libraries like `pandas` are used, ensuring focus on core programming principles and data visualization with `matplotlib`.

## Session 1: Python Refresher, OOP, and Building a Basic Banking System

### Key Topics:
1. **Data Types:**
    - Integer, String, List, Dictionary, and Tuple, with examples.
    
2. **Basic Control Structures:**
    - Conditional logic (`if`, `else`, `elif`) and loops (`for`, `while`).
    - Includes a brief example of list comprehensions.

3. **Functions and Modules:**
    - Introduction to reusable blocks of code with `def`.
    - Discusses the difference between functions and classes.

4. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):**
    - Explains OOP concepts including `__init__`, `self`, and method calls.
    - Includes comparisons between OOP and sequential programming.
    - Covers core OOP principles like **inheritance**, **polymorphism**, and **encapsulation**.
    
5. **Basic Banking System:**
    - Step-by-step example building a banking system with customer accounts, transaction history, deposits, and withdrawals using OOP.

### Exercises:
- Build upon the provided examples with practice tasks, including creating new accounts and using polymorphic methods.

## Session 2: Data Visualization with `matplotlib`

### Key Topics:
1. **Recap and OOP Best Practices:**
    - Modular code, use of meaningful variable names, encapsulation, and code reusability.

1. **Introduction to Visualization:**
    - Importance of visualization in banking analysis, and when to use different types of charts.

2. **Bar Charts:**
    - Simple bar chart example showing transaction types and their amounts.

3. **Line Charts:**
    - Example line chart demonstrating balance changes over time.

4. **Pie Charts:**
    - Pie chart visualizing the proportion of different transaction types.

5. **Best Practices in Visualization:**
    - Emphasis on choosing appropriate chart types, labeling axes, adding titles, and keeping visuals simple.

### Further Reading and Resources:
- Links to Python documentation, `matplotlib` documentation, and Python OOP tutorials.

## Usage

### Opening the Notebook
1. Download the notebook files in the `workbook` folder:
    - `01_refresher.ipynb`
    - `02_oop.ipynb`
    - `03_visualizations.ipynb`
2. Open the `ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
3. Follow along with the two-session tutorial, running code cells in sequence.

### Requirements
Ensure that `matplotlib` is installed in your environment. If not, install it via:

```bash
pip install matplotlib
